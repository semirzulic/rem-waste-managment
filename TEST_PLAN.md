# REM Waste Management - Test Plan & Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the REM Waste Management application, a full-stack React/Node.js application with automated test coverage for both UI and API components.

## What is Being Tested

### 1. Frontend Application (React/Next.js)
- **Login/Authentication System**: Valid/invalid credentials, session management, logout functionality
- **Dashboard CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete waste management items
- **Form Validation**: Input validation, error handling, required field checks
- **UI Components**: Modals, tables, buttons, responsive design across devices
- **User Experience**: Loading states, error messages, navigation flows

### 2. Backend API (Node.js/Express)
- **Authentication Endpoints**: POST /api/login with JWT token generation
- **Waste Items API**: Full CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /api/items)
- **Security Testing**: SQL injection prevention, token validation, timing attacks
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes, error messages, edge cases
- **Performance**: Concurrent request handling, bulk operations

### 3. Integration Testing
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete user journeys from login to data manipulation
- **API-Frontend Integration**: Data flow between React components and backend services
- **Authentication Flow**: Token-based authentication across the entire application

## Test Coverage Areas

### Functional Testing (95.1% Success Rate)
- **Login Scenarios**: 12 test cases covering valid/invalid credentials, session persistence
- **CRUD Operations**: 25+ test cases for creating, editing, deleting waste items
- **Form Validation**: Input validation for all data types (waste types, quantities, dates)
- **Data Integrity**: Verification of data persistence and retrieval accuracy

### Security Testing
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation, expiration handling, unauthorized access prevention
- **Input Sanitization**: SQL injection attempts, XSS prevention, malformed data handling
- **API Security**: Token-based authorization, proper error responses without information leakage

### Performance Testing
- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple simultaneous API requests
- **Bulk Data Handling**: Creating/updating multiple items simultaneously
- **Response Times**: API endpoint performance under normal load

### Cross-Browser Testing
- **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge support
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Testing across different viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Tools Used and Rationale

### Playwright Test Framework
**Why Chosen:**
- **Modern Architecture**: Built for modern web applications with excellent async support
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Native support for Chromium, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- **API Testing Capabilities**: Built-in HTTP client for API testing (alternative to Supertest)
- **Rich Debugging**: Screenshots, videos, traces, and detailed error reporting
- **CI/CD Ready**: Excellent GitHub Actions integration

### Page Object Model (POM)
**Implementation:**
- **LoginPage**: Handles all authentication-related interactions
- **DashboardPage**: Manages CRUD operations and form interactions
- **BasePage**: Common functionality shared across page objects

**Benefits:**
- **Maintainability**: Changes to UI elements require updates in only one location
- **Reusability**: Common actions can be shared across multiple test scenarios
- **Readability**: Tests read like user stories rather than technical implementations

### GitHub Actions CI Pipeline
**Features:**
- **Multi-Node Testing**: Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- **Automated Execution**: Runs on every push and pull request
- **Artifact Collection**: Stores test reports and screenshots for debugging
- **Clean Environment**: Fresh installation and setup for each test run

## How to Run the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

### Start Application Services
```bash
# Start both server and frontend
npm run dev:full

# Or start individually
npm run server    # API server on port 3001
npm run dev       # Next.js frontend on port 3000
```

### Execute Test Suites

#### API Tests
```bash
npm run test:api          # Run API tests only
```

#### UI/E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:ui           # Run E2E tests headless
npm run test:ui:headed    # Run with browser visible
npm run test:ui:debug     # Run in debug mode
```

#### All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all          # Run complete test suite with HTML report
npm run test:report       # View last test report
```

### CI Pipeline Testing
The GitHub Actions pipeline automatically runs all tests on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch

## Test Data Management

### Sample Data
- **Waste Types**: General Waste, Recycling, Hazardous, Electronic, Construction
- **Units**: kg, tonnes, litres, cubic_metres
- **Test Users**: Admin and Manager roles with different permissions

### Data Isolation
- Each test clears localStorage/sessionStorage before execution
- Tests use unique identifiers to avoid conflicts
- API tests use separate test data sets

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions
- **Local Development**: Tests assume local development environment (localhost)
- **Port Configuration**: Server on port 3001, frontend on port 3000
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support

### Current Limitations
- **Database**: Uses in-memory storage (no persistent database)
- **Visual Testing**: Basic implementation without comprehensive visual regression
- **Load Testing**: Limited to concurrent request testing, not full load testing
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design testing only, no native mobile app testing

### Known Issues
- **Modal Timing**: Occasional timing issues with modal close operations (14 failing tests)
- **Date Input Formatting**: Some date format validation edge cases
- **Concurrent Test Execution**: JSON parsing errors under high concurrency

## Success Metrics

### Current Achievement
- **Overall Success Rate**: 95.1% tests passing (579/609 tests)
- **API Test Coverage**: 100% of endpoints with positive and negative test cases
- **UI Test Coverage**: Complete user journey coverage from login to CRUD operations
- **Security Test Coverage**: Authentication, authorization, and input validation testing

### Quality Gates
- **Minimum Pass Rate**: 95% for CI pipeline success
- **Performance Threshold**: API responses under 200ms for standard operations
- **Security Requirements**: All authentication and authorization tests must pass

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance
- **Test Data Refresh**: Update test data sets monthly
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep Playwright and testing dependencies current
- **Browser Updates**: Verify compatibility with latest browser versions

### Continuous Improvement
- **Test Coverage Analysis**: Regular review of test coverage gaps
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution times and optimize slow tests
- **Flaky Test Management**: Identify and fix unstable tests promptly
